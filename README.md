# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective-SNHU-Travel-Project
This repository contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective document for the SNHU Travel project, which was developed as part of ChadaTech’s pilot transition to Scrum-Agile. The deliverable reflects on how team roles, communication, organizational tools, and adaptability supported the project’s success.

I interpret user needs by engaging with stakeholders, clarifying their expectations, and translating them into user stories with clear acceptance criteria. Creating user stories helps bridge the gap between what users want and what developers build because they describe features from the user’s perspective. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, a story like “As a budget traveler, I want to filter trips by price so that I can find affordable options” provided developers and testers with both context and measurable outcomes. This ensured that the program met real customer needs rather than assumptions.

I approach developing programs by starting small and refining features as feedback is received. Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily scrums, and retrospectives help me stay organized and adaptable. In future work, I want to continue using backlog refinement to keep tasks clear, sprint reviews to gather stakeholder feedback, and retrospectives to improve team performance. These practices create transparency, reduce miscommunication, and allow me to deliver value continuously.

Being a good team member means contributing not only code but also collaboration, communication, and support for others. It requires openness to feedback, accountability for tasks, and a willingness to help resolve blockers. In the SNHU Travel project, for example, the tester and product owner worked together to clarify whether a feature should be displayed as a list or slideshow. This collaboration prevented delays and ensured alignment with user expectations. A good team member fosters trust, shares knowledge, and values the collective success of the project over individual recognition.
